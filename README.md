# Nagios-NCPA-Automation
This hasn't been updated for a while (disregard commit date), it hasn't been updated since early 2018 after I got rid of my local Nagios XI test lab.

The PSExec & ncpa-2.1.3.exe files are not the actual executables, they're empty text files serving as a place holder. Replace these with the actual executables you require.
